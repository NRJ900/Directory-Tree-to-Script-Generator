  "description": "As AI-powered coding tools and \"vibe coding\" become the standard for rapid development, developers frequently encounter project setups that require specific file and folder structures. Whether it's setting up a new Tauri app, organizing microservices, or implementing a full-stack architecture, manually creating dozens of nested folders and files is tedious and error-prone. This web application solves that friction by instantly converting directory tree visualizations into executable code. Simply paste your project structure (like those commonly provided in AI-generated code templates), select your preferred output format (Python or Command Prompt), and get ready-to-run scripts that create the entire folder hierarchy with proper file extensions and nesting.",
